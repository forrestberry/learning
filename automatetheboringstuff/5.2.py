# Chess Dictionary Validator
# Write a function named isValidChessBoard() that takes a dictionary argument
# and returns True or False depending on if the board is valid.
# A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king. Each
# player can only have at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and all pieces must be
# on a valid space from '1a' to '8h'; that is, a piece canâ€™t be on space '9z'.
# The piece names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to represent white or black,
# followed by 'pawn', 'knight', 'bishop', 'rook', 'queen', or 'king'. This
# function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper chess board.
