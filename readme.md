# Intro

Goal is to know programming on a general level, so that I can do what I want
with my computer quickly.

Project goal is to create a free online seminary in the codecademy style.

Potential other goal is career shift to programming in order to spend more time
with my family and have financial resources to enjoy life with them (college
savings, vacations, retirement). Ministry is still important but may take a
different path than previously thought.
